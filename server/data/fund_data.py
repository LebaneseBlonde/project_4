        description = 'The Fox and Firkin doors have sadly closed! We are facing one of the most challenging times, struggling to survive and plan for the future of one of our community’s favourite grass roots live music venues. We have been forced to close to support the UK’s health service and reduce the risk to the public – however we are still faced with £14K a month in running costs of the venue. Since 16th December we have lost over £80K and day by day we continue to mount up more debt. We have listened to our community and decided to ask for your help...if we could survive without it, then we would not be asking. Our venue is what it is because of YOU and if you can offer any support to HELP us to keep it going and keep our doors open in the future, we will be grateful and continue to give you the experience that so many love at The Fox and Firkin!'
