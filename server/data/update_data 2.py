With the help of the guys here at crowdfunder, we've extended the time frame a little and also added a few more donation rewards such as sending a cocktail pouch through the post to you for a tenner! If those go quick we'll happily do more batches of them. Please also take a look at the wines, beers, and spirits available, you'll be able to both support us and get drunk in private at the same time!",

Since the lockdown is open-ended for now, we can't realistically reset a re-opening date. As soon as we have a better idea of when this lockdown is going to let up, and when we are likely to be able to trade without fear of another lockdown, we will firm a date up and announce it to you! In the meantime, we are continuing with our plans in getting the pub ready for business. We will continue to apply for the grants available to us and continue to hold out for when we can get our doos open, and welcome you back.",

        title = 'A Massive thank you!',
        content = "Firstly, a massive thanks for your support. We will not be able to say this louder or clearer or more whole-heartedly. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH! We have raised a really helpful amount of £10,519 with 148 supporters in 77 days, including £4000 Match Funding from the Mayor Of London. Being completely honest here, at the start of this campaign, we were hopeful for £5000 raised in a few weeks. That would get us through the wastage and the restocking that we anticipated a short period of lockdown would require. As the crowdfunder end date drew closer, we could see that the pub was still some way off being able to reopen. We took the decision to extend the campaign to get us in a position to be able to stay closed a little longer to then be able to viably reopen. You guys met our needs and supported us so that we could gain further support beyond our target figure, which touched us and also spurred us on. We are so very grateful to have had you following our story, cheering us on through your comments, thoughts and generous support. We're incredibly blown away with the kindness and magnanimity of your actions. You have been so great and it has made us miss having you all down the pub even more!",

The whole team are immensely grateful for every single message of support and donation.
